# About AndroidIDE

AndroidIDE is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Android applications on Android
devices. It provides full support for the Gradle build system, Kotlin build
support, Java/XML completions, and much more.

AndroidIDE is designed to be a portable IDE that can be used on any Android device with a minimum of 2GB
